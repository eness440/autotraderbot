trade_metrics.py
-----------------

This module provides helper functions to compute more accurate trade exit
metrics such as the volume‑weighted average price (VWAP) of a set of fills,
the total fees paid across those fills, and the realised slippage relative
to a reference mid‑price.  It is intended to be used during trade closure
to replace simplistic exit price estimates with a true aggregated value.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

``async compute_vwap_and_fee(exchange, symbol, since_ts)``
    Fetches recent fills for ``symbol`` via ``fetch_my_trades`` and
    returns the VWAP of all fills executed since ``since_ts`` along with
    the total fee paid.  If no fills are found, ``None`` is returned for
    both values.

``calculate_slippage(entry_mid_price, exit_price, side)``
    Computes the realised slippage as a positive fraction based on the
    difference between the entry mid‑price and the executed exit price.
    For long positions, only downside slippage is considered; for
    shorts, only upside slippage is counted.  If a favourable move
    occurred, the slippage is zero.

    This helper calls ``fetch_my_trades`` via the provided ``exchange`` to
    retrieve up to ``max_trades`` recent trades for the specified OKX
    symbol (e.g. ``BTC‑USDT‑SWAP``).  It then filters those trades by
    timestamp (if ``since_ts`` is provided) and calculates the VWAP and
    total fee paid.  The side of the most recent trade is also returned
    to aid downstream slippage calculations.
